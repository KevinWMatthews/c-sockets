Add functions to get the source vs the destination IP address and port.
    TCP Clients should return a NULL source address and port?
    TCP Clients should return a valid destination if they have been connected.
    TCP Servers should return a valid source if they have been bound.
    TCP Servers should return a NULL if they have been not bound.
    UDP Clients should return a NULL source address. Port?
    etc. Figure this out.

Rethink and recompare new tests to old.
    Should we close after tests?
    Should we split test files?

Refactor setting Open() expectations. Create helper methods to:
    Set TCP socket.
    Set UDP socket.

Come up with a different way to parse program options:
    Getopt (try this first?).
    Argp
These are both GNU C library modules.

Does Connect() block at the system level? Update documentation accordingly.

Clean up socket system layer:
    Add documentation.
    Clear stored socket settings?
        domain
    Store other SocketSettings?
        type
        protocol
    Extract converting address and port ( inet_addr(), htons() ).

Allow flags in Send().
Allow flags in Receive().

Write some demo programs and see if they can connect!
Create send() and receive() to make sure that it really works. :)

Make a distclean option. Remove build, obj, all build directories.

Figure out why moving Server to ./ would prevent Server from being build.

Handle signals in products. Ctrl+C, etc.
