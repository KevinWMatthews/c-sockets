Figure out why test Socket.o files conflict with production .o files and how to fix it.
    If test code is run first, cpputest_calloc_location() and cpputest_free_location() are undefined.
    If production code is run first, these function are not inserted so memory leak checks will never fail. Silent and deadly.

Document return values in Socket.h.
Can Socket_Close() fail?

Add is_connected flag?

Should a bind with a null address bind to any address? Maybe so, but work through the entire example first.

Should the backlog be part of the Socket struct?

I'm being inconsistent with return values between UnixSocket and Socket modules.

Add options for flags to Socket_Send().

Remove MSG_NOSIGNAL and allow the user to customize how to handle SIGPIPE errors.

Add a name to each Socket struct.
