Rethink and recompare new tests to old.
    Should we close after tests?
    Should we split test files?

Refactor setting Open() expectations. Create helper methods to:
    Set TCP socket.
    Set UDP socket.

Come up with a different way to parse program options:
    Getopt (try this first?).
    Argp
These are both GNU C library modules.

Clean up socket system layer:
    Extract converting address and port.
    Figure out how to get sin_family (AF_INET) as an argument. It must be configurable.
        It is/should be stored with the Socket in a higher layer.
        It should probably be another argument....

Allow flags in Send().
Allow flags in Receive().

Write some demo programs and see if they can connect!
Create send() and receive() to make sure that it really works. :)

Make a distclean option. Remove build, obj, all build directories.

Figure out why moving Server to ./ would prevent Server from being build.

Handle signals in products. Ctrl+C, etc.
