Rethink and recompare new tests to old.
    Should we close after tests?
    Should we split test files?

Refactor setting Open() expectations. Create helper methods to:
    Set TCP socket.
    Set UDP socket.

Come up with a different way to parse program options:
    Getopt (try this first?).
    Argp
These are both GNU C library modules.

Clean up socket system layer:
    Add documentation.
    Clear stored socket settings?
        domain
    Store other SocketSettings?
        type
        protocol
    Extract converting address and port ( inet_addr(), htons() ).

Allow flags in Send().
Allow flags in Receive().

Write some demo programs and see if they can connect!
Create send() and receive() to make sure that it really works. :)

Make a distclean option. Remove build, obj, all build directories.

Figure out why moving Server to ./ would prevent Server from being build.

Handle signals in products. Ctrl+C, etc.
