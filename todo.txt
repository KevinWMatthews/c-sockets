Figure out why test Socket.o files conflict with production .o files and how to fix it.
    If test code is run first, cpputest_calloc_location() and cpputest_free_location() are undefined.
    If production code is run first, these function are not inserted so memory leak checks will never fail. Silent and deadly.

Document return values in Socket.h.
Can Socket_Close() fail?

Add is_connected flag?

Should a bind with a null address bind to any address? Maybe so, but work through the entire example first.

Should the backlog be part of the Socket struct?
