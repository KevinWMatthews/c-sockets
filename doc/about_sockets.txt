internet sockets, unix sockets, etc
There are several kinds of internet sockets:
    stream sockets
    datagram sockets
    raw sockets

Stream sockets:
    Two-way, connection-based data stream.
    Data arrives in order.
    Use TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for transmitting data.

    Clients:
        Create the socket with socket().
        Connect to a remote socket with connect().
        Send data with send() or write().
            send() has flags, write() does not. send() with flags set to 0 is equivalent to write().
        Receive data with recv() or read().
            ?
        Close the socket with close().

    Servers:
        Create the socket with socket().
        Bind to an address and port with bind().
        Listen for incoming connections with listen().
        Accept incoming connections with accept().
        Receive data with recv() or read().
            ?
        Send data with send() or write().
            send() has flags, write() does not. send() with flags set to 0 is equivalent to write().
        Close the socket with close().

Datagram sockets:
    Connectionless. Just send the data, and that's it.
    Uses UDP (User Datagram Protocol) for transmitting data.

    Clients:
        Create the socket with socket().
        You can call connect() on a UDP socket but it is not necessary.
            It does nothing on the remote end; it only conditions the local interface.
            If you do this, the socket will only receive on the address and will send to this address by default.
            This allows you to use recv() and send().
        In general, receive and send data with recvfrom() and sendto().
            You can use recv() and send() if connect() was called.
        Close the socket with close().

    Servers:
        Create the socket with socket().
        Bind to an address and port with bind().
            You must call bind() on a UDP socket. Clients need a fixed port number to send to.
        Receive data with recvfrom().
            recv() is not allowed.
        Send data with sendto().
            send() is not allowed.
        Close the socket with close().
